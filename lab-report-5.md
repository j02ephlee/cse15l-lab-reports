# LAB REPORT 5

---

For this lab report, I have decided to use our group's representative markdown-parser repository (belongs to Nuojinli Xu).

## Vim Diff comparison

I used ```vimdiff``` to display the difference in results between the cse15lsp22 markdown parser and the one from our group's markdown parser.
```
vimdiff my-markdown-parser/results.txt cse15lsp22-markdown-parser/results.txt
```

For this lab report, I will focus on test files [194](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-files/194.md) and [201](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-files/201.md).
